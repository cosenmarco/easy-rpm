    // part of the name (up to the first space).

    // version specified should be as close as possible to the format of the
    // original software's version. In most cases, there should be no problem
    // specifying the version just as the software's original developer did.

    // software at a particular version is first packaged, the release should
    // be "1". If it is necessary to repackage that software at the same
    // version, the release should be incremented. When a new version of the
    // software becomes available, the release should drop back to "1" when it
    // is first packaged.

    // before more detailed ones.
