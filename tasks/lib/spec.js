    // specifying the version just as the software's original developer did.

    // software at a particular version is first packaged, the release should
    // be "1". If it is necessary to repackage that software at the same

    // public relations contact.

    // to have certain capabilities available in order to operate properly.

    // package provided by one or more packages that use the provides tag. When
    // the requires tag references a package name, version comparisons may also
